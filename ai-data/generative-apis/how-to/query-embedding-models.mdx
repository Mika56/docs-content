Scaleway's Generative AI service allows users to interact with powerful embedding models hosted on the platform.
The service uses the OpenAI SDK to enable communication with the models, providing a simple interface for generating vector representations (embeddings) based on your input data. 
The Scaleway console provides a complete playground, where you can test models, adapt parameters, and observe how these changes affect the output in real time.

<Macro id=" requirements"/>

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) (Necessary for API authentication)
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

## Accessing the Playground

The Playground within the Scaleway console offers an intuitive interface for experimenting with embedding models.

1. Click **Generative APIs** in the **AI** section of the side menu of the Scaleway console. The [list of available serverless models](https://console.scaleway.com/generative-apis/) displays.
2. Click <Icon name= "more"/> next to the name of the embedding model you want to use. Then click **Try model** in the pop-up menu. The **Playground** displays.
3. Enter your input data in the form to start generating embeddings.

In the Playground, you can enter input data, adjust model parameters, and immediately see the results of your queries. This is an excellent way to understand the capabilities of the models and fine-tune your inputs for better results.

## Querying embedding models via API

While the Playground provides a hands-on environment for testing, you can also query the models programmatically using the OpenAI SDK.

### Installing the OpenAI SDK

First, ensure you have the OpenAI SDK installed in your development environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openai
```

### Initializing the client

Initialize the OpenAI client with your base URL and API key:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client with your base URL and API key
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://bccf05e2-55e1-4e42-aeec-87e153b7e552.ifr.fr-par.scw.cloud/v1",  # Scaleway's Generative AI endpoint
    api_key="<SCW_API_KEY>"  # Your unique API key from Scaleway
)
```

### Generating embeddings with sentence-T5-XXL

You can now generate embeddings using the `sentence-T5-XXL` model. Follwoing is an example:

```python
# Generate embeddings using the 'sentence-T5-XXL' model
embedding_response = client.embeddings.create(
    input= "Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world.",
    model= "sentence-T5-XXL"
)

# Output the embedding vector
print(embedding_response.data[0].embedding)
```

This code sends input text to the `sentence-T5-XXL` embedding model and returns a vector representation of the text. The `sentence-T5-XXL` model is specifically designed for generating high-quality sentence embeddings.

### Model parameters and their effects

The following parameters can be adjusted to influence the output of the embedding model:

- **`input`**: The text or data you want to convert into an embedding.
- **`model`**: The specific embedding model to use, in this case, `sentence-T5-XXL`.
- **`user`**: A unique identifier representing your end user, which can be used for tracking and personalization.

 You can experiment with these parameters in the Playground to see how they affect the model's embeddings.

## Advanced usage tips

### Using the Playground for fine-tuning

The Playground allows you to test and tweak your inputs and fine-tune parameters interactively. This can help you identify the best settings for your application without writing any code.

For example, you can:

- Modify the input text to see how it affects the resulting embedding vector.
- Switch between different embedding models to compare results and find the best fit for your use case.

### Batch processing

For bulk processing of embeddings, you can use the API to send multiple inputs in a single request by using loops in your code. This can be particularly useful for generating embeddings for large datasets or processing numerous inputs simultaneously.

Example:

```python
inputs = [
    "The future of AI is bright.",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.",
    "Data science involves statistics and programming."
]

embedding_responses = [client.embeddings.create(
    input=input_text,
    model="sentence-T5-XXL"
) for input_text in inputs]

for i, response in enumerate(embedding_responses):
    print(f"Embedding {i + 1}: {response.data[0].embedding}")
```
